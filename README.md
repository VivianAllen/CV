## Something Else

**Some emphasis here**   
*some other emphasis here*

some stuff in a table!  |  headings in here |  
--|---|
everything else here  | what decides table width? Who knows? Oh it autowraps, sweet   |  
  |   |  


## what controls how much


m

## space is between headings?



regular old text here, formatting is done automatically but capitalization isn't.

### suheadings are automatically

## spaced too!

#### do you get sub-subheadings?
##### and sub-sub-subheadings?
###### sub-sub-sub-subheadings is as far as it goes
####### now it just looks like something has been censored

now all it needs is some content




## spacing is automatic!
