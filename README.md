- Former research scientist in evolutionary biomechanics (WHICH IS WHAT) who has JOURNEY TO CODE
- led challenging research projects and published the results in the BEST JOURNALS IN FIELD.
- would like to use problem solving and technical skills I have developed to make things (BIT OF JOB I ALWAYS LIKED).
- ideal position is something of humanitarian benefit: ngo, healthcare, education, political


## PROJECTS
| Project       | Summary       | Technologies  | Testing |
| ------------- |---------------| --------------|---------|
| 1. 3D mesh mass estimation in Matlab ([Github](https://github.com/VivianAllen/obj_file_mass_properties)) | A set of Matlab functions for estimating the mass of complex 3D shapes, designed to estimate extinct dinosaur mass properties. The first piece of useful software I wrote!  | [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) | This was written way before I had even heard of TDD! |
| 2. Takeaway Challenge in Ruby ([Github](https://github.com/VivianAllen/takeaway-challenge)) | A basic, object-based system for creating and managing takeway orders. The weekend homework project for my second week of coding at Makers Academy. By this point I felt like I was starting to become comfortable with OOP principles and TDD. Also my first use of an API (sending order confirmation SMS via. [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)) | [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) | [Rspec for Ruby](http://rspec.info/)|
