here is now a doc link works: [label](#heading here)

[Link Test](#test) | [Redundant Link Test](#test) | [Something Else](#something Else) | [subheading link test](##spaced too!)

## Test

#### A Subheading

here is how a piped link works: [early internet hightlight](http://gothsuptrees.net/)

|Some stuff in a box?  |
|--------------------- |
| dunno how this works yet. Ah, there we go! |
## Something Else

**Some emphasis here**   
*some other emphasis here*

some stuff in a table!  |  headings in here |  
--|---|
everything else here  | what decides table width? Who knows? Oh it autowraps, sweet   |  
  |   |  


## what controls how much




## space is between headings?



regular old text here, formatting is done automatically but capitalization isn't.

### suheadings are automatically

## spaced too!

#### do you get sub-subheadings?
##### and sub-sub-subheadings?
###### sub-sub-sub-subheadings is as far as it goes
####### now it just looks like something has been censored

now all it needs is some content




## spacing is automatic!
