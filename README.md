| ------------- |---------------| --------------|---------|
| 1. 3D mesh mass estimation ([Github](https://github.com/VivianAllen/obj_file_mass_properties)) | Matlab functions for estimating the mass properties of complex 3D shapes, designed to work with models of extinct dinosaurs. The first piece of useful software I wrote!  | [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) | Predates my exposure to TDD! |
| 2. Takeaways ([Github](https://github.com/VivianAllen/takeaway-challenge)) | Object-based system for creating and managing takeaway orders. Weekend homework project for second week at Makers Academy. Starting to understand OOP principles and TDD.  First API use (sending order confirmation SMS via. [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)) | [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) | [Rspec](http://rspec.info/)|
| 3. Bowling Scores ([Github](https://github.com/VivianAllen/bowling-challenge))| Single-page web app for calculating bowling scores.
